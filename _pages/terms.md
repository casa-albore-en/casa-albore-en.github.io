The rental periods in July / August are from Saturday at 4pm until the
following Saturday at 10 am. Outside of that period, we rent for a
minimum of 4 nights without fixed start days.

When a reservation request is made, we will acknowledge the request
and send you a contract to be signed in double and returned within a
week together with a 25% deposit. The reservation will be cancelled if
we do not receive the contract and cheque on time (cheque can be in
UKP upon prior arrangement, and inter-bank transfer in the UK is also
acceptable).  The remainder of the rental fee must be paid one calendar
month prior to the start of the rental.

Maximum occupancy must not exceed the advertised number of places in a
gite. Children under 3 years of age are not counted in the total
headcount.

Casa Albore is a non-smoking house. You can smoke on the ground-floor
terrace or outside.

Electricity, gas, heating and wood for the winter are included in the
price.

Linen including sheets and bath-towels can be rented for 10€ per person.

A cleaning service is offered at a cost of 50€ / gite.

We accept animals if they aren’t too excitable and do not risk
degrading the gite, since we want to be able to continue to offer an
outstanding gite for people to stay!
