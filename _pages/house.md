excerpt: 'Welcome to Casa Albore We are delighted to be able to show you our beautiful house in Corsica, a traditional stone house in a small hamlet in Cap Corse, with a view over the maquis and to the sea, with the isle of Capraia on the horizon.

The house has two separate gites, one for 6-7 people, and one for 5 people, which can be rented separately or reunited for larger gatherings of family or friends.

We fell in love with this house and its surroundings, and hope that you will too!
