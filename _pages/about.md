![Nous]({{ base_path }}/images/front/web/nous.png)

We’re an anglo-corsican family, living in the French alps, with three
children, the first aged 16, and 13 year old twins (in 2016).

Jocelyne grew up in Bastia and in [Cap Corse]({{ base_path }}/region/), and she’s shared her love
of the region with the family. After many years holidaying in Corsica,
especially around Patrimonio where her mother lived, we’ve taken the
step of buying our own holiday home. Nick moved to the French alps
from England many years ago and met Jocelyne... he works as a software
architect and is lucky enough to often be able to work from Corsica during
the school holidays...

We fell in love with [Casa Albore]({{ base_path }}/) as soon as we saw the
house. It’s a typical old corsican house, with 3-foot thick stone
walls and wooden beams, in a region that’s almost completely unspoiled
by tourism, and has a superb view out over the maquis and the sea. The
house has been lived in year round and lovingly renovated over 30
years by the previous owners, M. et Mme. Savoldelli. He’s a retired
cabinet maker so you can imagine the attention that has been put into
the work. The Savoldellis still live in the region, and take care of
the house when we are not there.
